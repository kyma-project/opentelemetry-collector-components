## Overview

Contains a custom distribution of the [OTel Collector Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) bundle with additional [OTel Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) components used by the [Kyma Telemetry module](https://github.com/kyma-project/telemetry-manager/tree/main). The additional components are either general and planned to be contributed to the upstream contrib repo, or Kyma-specific.

For actual distribution configuration, see [OTel Collector Docker Image](./otel-collector/).

The additional components are located in the [receiver](./receiver/) folder.
